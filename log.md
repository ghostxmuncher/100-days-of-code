**Today's Progress**: Worked on HTML-Cat photo app on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** HTML is not as bad as I thought it would be, it's light and easy. <img> and <input> tags are self closing

**Today's Progress**: Started the foundations course for the Odin Project. Found a couple good bookmarks for typing practice and learning how to learn. There's some good articles on how to ask good questions. 

***Knowledge Check***: Name at least one thing your question should include 1) Code/Context. Describe the XY problem 2) It's where the questioner asks about how to reach their solution (Y) even though their real problem/question lies with (X). Ask X first, worry about Y later. Describe 3 attributes of a help vampire 3) They are usually male lol, ask really vague broad questions, and prey on good natured helpers to do the work for them, they're defensive as well. 

**Thoughts**: I feel confident going through the foundations course whilst already having dipped my toes in a little bit previously. I'm excited and motivated to stay consist and build some cool shit!
